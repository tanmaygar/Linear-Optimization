Assumption
1. Polytope is non-degenerate.
2. Rak of A is n 

Implement the simplex algorithm to maximize the objective function, You need to implement the method discussed in class. 

Input: CSV file with m+2 rows and n+1 column. 
             The first row excluding the last element is the initial feasible point z of length n
             The second row excluding the last element is the cost vector c of length n
             The last column excluding the top two elements is the constraint vector b of length m
             Rows third to m+2 and column one to n is the matrix A of size m*n

Output: You need to print the sequence of vertices visited and the value of the objective function at that vertex
